    "Most of the common operations on DataFrame/Dataset are supported for streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already seen that operations such as: `filter`, `groupBy`, `select` can be applied on streaming Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformations Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operations that are offered by the standard DataFrame API do not make sense on a streaming context or would be very diffucult to implement on streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations not supported on streaming datasets are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* limit / take(n)\n",
    "* distinct - would require infinite memory and computational complexity of $O(n^2)$ \n",
    "* some outer joins \n",
    "* count - cannot return a single count from a streaming dataset. Hoewever, we can use count on grouped data\n",
    "* show - requires an immediate materialization of the query. Instead we can use `console` sink\n",
    "* foreach - cannot be used directly on a stream, but there is a `foreach` sink that provides the same functionality\n"

    "## Event time processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Streaming processes data based on event time, inferring their timeline by tracking a continuously increasing upper bound of the timestamp field. This timeline serves as the primary clock for time-based processing. Structured Streaming's understanding of event time allows it to separate event generation from processing time. In particular, we can replay a sequence of past events and produced the correct results for all event-time aggregations. We could, for example, replay a weekâ€™s worth of events in a few minutes and have our system produce results consistent with a week period.\n",
