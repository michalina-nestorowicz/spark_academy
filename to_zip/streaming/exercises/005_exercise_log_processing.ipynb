    "\n",
    "The company `SparkyCO` have noticed more than usual servers connectivity disruptions. You were given a task to investigate that and monitor all requests processed by the severs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to process sever access logs, monitor incoming traffic and detect any anomaly in 1 hour windows.\n",
    "The logs entries are qritten in format known as *Common Log Format* (CLF), standard format that can be produced by many different web servers and read by many log analysis programs.\n",

    "Example log entry:\n",
    "> 127.0.0.1 - - [26/Apr/2024:07:20:39 +0000] \"GET /lists HTTP/1.0\" 200 2503\n",

    "Provided information from that entry: \n",
    "1. IP address of the client (remote host) that made request to the server\n",
    "2. First \"hypen\" indicates that requested piece of information is not available\n",
    "3. User id of the person reqesting. If the requested document does not need authentication, this part will also be just a \"hypen\"\n",
